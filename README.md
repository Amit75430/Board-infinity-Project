Instruction about this project
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architecture that allows client-server communication through a uniform interface. 
REST is stateless, cachable and has property called idempotence. It means that the side effect of identical requests have the same side-effect as a single request.

HTTP RESTful APIâ€™s are compose of:

HTTP methods, e.g. GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, POST

In this project, i used node.js,express,mongodb in REST API.
In NodeJS allows you to run Javascript outside the browser, in this case, on the web server. NPM allows you to install/publish node packages with ease.
ExpressJS is a web application framework that runs on NodeJS. It allows you to build web applications and API endpoints.
I created a rest folder first, and then add express as a dependency. I use NPM init command to get us started.Express should be added to package.json
Mongoose is an NPM package that allows you to interact with MongoDB.
CRUD == Create-Read-Update-Delete

Here I used to create, read and delete data from MongoDB using Mongoose/Node.
